// Declaring Variables

// There are three ways to declare a variable in JavaScript, and each has a slightly different use case. All three methods follow the same syntax, but use a different keyword

// Variables should be declared that the name represents the data they are storing and manipulating

let myVar = "a Variable";

const myVarAgain = "a Variable";

var myVarThree  = "a Variable";
